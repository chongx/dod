Do or Die
==

A 2D instance platforming mmorpg with rogue-like qualities, grinding, bosses, and pvp.

Basic Ideas
==
<li>
All gameplay happens in an instance (d3 style), each instance is rogue-like
You decide what to bring into an instance, if you die you lose everything you brought and found (maybe only reveal what loot you got at the end of instance)
    Infinite loadouts, choose whichever is suitable before entering instance
    Default loadout is just a sword (so there's no stupid fist fighting when you have an empty inventory)
    Also cosmetic loadouts
Separate loot drops for different players in an instance
Infinite inventory space (or maybe limited and pay for more hoho)
Tier-based gear (Tier 1 - Tier 10(?), lowest to highest)
    Can "delete" gear to get a chance of receiving gear of the next tier (same rarity)
        This creates value for low tier gear
        Cannot delete Legendaries
Each instance has a tier level, can only receive gear of that tier from the instance
    Can only wear gear of that tier level or lower into the instance, to prevent people with really good gear from farming lower tiers
    Each tier requires better stats (for example 400 armor in tier 1 = 50% dmg reduction, 400 armor in tier 5 is 5% dmg reduction, ballpark numbers)
Higher risk = higher reward
Skill orbs are equipped to give you skills, up to 5(?)
    Semi rare drop, can be dropped from any boss
    Need to think up a skill orb sink
    Maybe have skill orb leveling
    Skill setup is part of loadout
Boss at the end of every instance, kill boss to finish
    Door appears, you can walk through it to leave instance with all your gear
NO GOLD ONLY TRADING BETWEEN INTERESTED PARTIES
    Can advertise and search for specific trades like on dota2lounge
Consumables can also drop and be traded (also have tiers, each tier increases effect/duration)
    Hp pot - NOT INSTANT, decide how many you want to bring in at the beginning
    Mana pot
    Speed pot
    Invis pot
Each additional player in your party increases difficulty, but also more % chance of dropping 2/3/4/5 pieces of loot.
Maybe have maps that drop at highest normally accessible tier for giving access to next tier and special legendaries like PoE
</li>

Instance Design
==
Somewhat dynamically generated map (some basic room building blocks, set of these per tier)
Boss and boss room are custom designed for every tier
Random mods for uncommon and rare mobs like in PoE
Several base mob types for each tier

PVP Possibilities
Can fight 1v1 for ALL gear worn into fight - All or Nothing
    Tier restricted to make it fair, also show gear score of opponent (but not specific loadout)
Can decide on gear to bet with - Honor Fight
Team based (no risk), receive points to buy cosmetic items from cosmetic store

People still like some sort of progression, maybe have 20 levels or so (not too grindy) and put into stats (10 stat points per level) so there is some possibility for customization, then have
non-combat related leveling system afterwards (like paragon in d3), so each paragon level just gives 3% MF and pretty profile borders or something.
